### Machine Learning 

[Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis Using PyCaret](https://github.com/koayst/pycaret_pima-indians-diabetes)
<br>
PyCaret, an open source low-code machine learning library in Python, was announced on 16 April 2020. It promises to be an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few words only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient.

[Analytics Vidhya Challenges - Loan Prediction](https://github.com/koayst/analytics_vidhya_loan_prediction)
<br>
An attempt to challenges the loan prediction problem at Analytics Vidhya web site.  First I will use the traditional machine learning library (scikit-learn) to model the loan application.  Then, with a new tool launched, I will attempt to use PyCaret to quickly model the loan application.  Indeed, PyCaret was easy to use and the result, upon submission, beat the predictions from the traditional method.

**Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP)**<br>
(6 January to 17 April 2020)

- [Capstone Project](https://github.com/koayst/rp_capstone)
This project is a collaboration between Nvidia and Republic Polytechnic (RP). The goal of this project is to provide an annotation tool, to differentiate key takeaways in a corpus of text. The summarisation technique will be powered by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models.
